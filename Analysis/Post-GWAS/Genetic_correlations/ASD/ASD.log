Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)
P:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /mnt/data0/home/khu/ldsc/eur_w_ld_chr/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from iPSYCH-PGC_ASD_Nov2017 into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 9112386 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 7950527 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 111466 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 85 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1050308 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1050308 SNPs remain).
Median value of OR was 1.0001, which seems sensible.
