Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
BETA:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
PVAL:	p-Value
N_CAS:	Number of cases
N_CON:	Number of controls
N:	Sample size

Read 7659767 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 6477963 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 46525 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1135279 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1135279 SNPs remain).
Removed 2078 SNPs with N < 87095.99999999987 (1133201 SNPs remain).
Median value of BETA was -0.000400080021339691, which seems sensible.
Removed 1 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1133200 SNPs remain).
