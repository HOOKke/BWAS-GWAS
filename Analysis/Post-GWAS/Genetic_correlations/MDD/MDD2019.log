Interpreting column names as follows:
MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
LogOR:	Directional summary statistic as specified by --signed-sumstats.
P:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /mnt/data0/home/khu/ldsc/eur_w_ld_chr/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from PGC_UKB_depression_genome-wide.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8483301 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 7308649 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1174652 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1174652 SNPs remain).
Using N = 500199.0
Median value of SIGNED_SUMSTATS was 0.0, which seems sensible.
Removed 0 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1174652 SNPs remain).
