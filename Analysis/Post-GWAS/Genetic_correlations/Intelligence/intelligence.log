Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
EAF_HRC:	Allele frequency
Zscore:	Z-score (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
P:	p-Value
N_analyzed:	Sample size

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /mnt/data0/home/khu/ldsc/eur_w_ld_chr/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from SavageJansen_2018_intelligence_metaanalysis.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 9295118 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 8098404 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 9372 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1187342 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1187342 SNPs remain).
Removed 39010 SNPs with N < 179413.33333333334 (1148332 SNPs remain).
Median value of Zscore was -0.002, which seems sensible.
Removed 3 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1148329 SNPs remain).
