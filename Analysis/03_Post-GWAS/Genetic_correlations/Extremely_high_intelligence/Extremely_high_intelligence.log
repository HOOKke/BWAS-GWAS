Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Z:	Z-score (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
P:	p-Value

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /mnt/data0/home/khu/ldsc/eur_w_ld_chr/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from Coleman_29520040_Sumstats.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 5383054 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 4399529 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
983525 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (983525 SNPs remain).
Median value of Z was 0.001, which seems sensible.
Removed 0 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (983525 SNPs remain).
