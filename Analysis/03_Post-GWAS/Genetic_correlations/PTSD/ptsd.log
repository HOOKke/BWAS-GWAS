Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
INFO:	INFO score (imputation quality; higher --> better imputation)
OR:	Odds ratio (1 --> no effect; above 1 --> A1 is risk increasing)
P:	p-Value
Nca:	Number of cases
Nco:	Number of controls

Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 9766174 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 8579084 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 14423 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 88 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
