Interpreting column names as follows:
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
Beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
P:	p-Value
N:	Sample size
N_CAS:	Number of cases
N_CON:	Number of controls

Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from CUD_EUR_casecontrol_public_11.14.2020 into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 8851634 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 7679426 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 116 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1172092 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1172092 SNPs remain).
Removed 57928 SNPs with N < 237962.92208720522 (1114164 SNPs remain).
Median value of Beta was 0.0, which seems sensible.
