Interpreting column names as follows:
MarkerName:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
Effect_allele:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
Other_allele:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
Beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /mnt/data0/home/khu/ldsc/eur_w_ld_chr/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from Davies2018_UKB_RT_summary_results_29052018.txt into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 18485867 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 17274680 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1211187 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1211187 SNPs remain).
Using N = 300486.0
Median value of Beta was 2.0412e-06, which seems sensible.
Removed 3 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1211184 SNPs remain).
